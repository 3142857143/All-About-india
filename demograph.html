  <h2 id="two">Demographics of India
  </h2>
  <p id="one">India is the most populated country in the world with one-sixth of the world's population. According to official estimates in 2022, India's population stood at over 1.4 billion.

  Between 1975 and 2010, the population doubled to 1.2 billion, reaching the billion mark in 2000. India is expected to overtake China to become the most populous country by the end of April 2023. It is expected to become the first country to be home to more than 1.5 billion people by 2030, and its population is set to reach 1.7 billion by 2050. However, its pace of population growth is slowing. In 2017 its population growth rate was 0.98%, ranking 112th in the world; in contrast, from 1972 to 1983, India's population grew by an annual rate of 2.3%.

  In 2022, the median age of an Indian was 28.7 years, compared to 38.4 for China and 48.6 for Japan; and, by 2030; India's dependency ratio will be just over 0.4. However, the number of children in India peaked more than a decade ago and is now falling. The number of children under the age of five peaked in 2007, and since then the number has been falling. The number of Indians under 15 years old peaked slightly later (in 2011) and is now also declining.

  India has more than two thousand ethnic groups, and every major religion is represented, as are four major families of languages (Indo-European, Dravidian, Austroasiatic and Sino-Tibetan languages) as well as two language isolates: the Nihali language, spoken in parts of Maharashtra, and the Burushaski language, spoken in parts of Jammu and Kashmir. 1,000,000 people in India are Anglo-Indians and 700,000 United States citizens are living in India. They represent over 0.1% of the total population of India. Overall, only the continent of Africa exceeds the linguistic, genetic and cultural diversity of the nation of India.

  The sex ratio was 944 females for 1000 males in 2016, and 940 per 1000 in 2011. This ratio has been showing an upwards trend for the last two decades after a continuous decline in the last century.

<h2 id="four">Fertility Rate of india
  </h2>
  <p id="three">The General Fertility Rate (GFR) has declined in India by 20% over the past decade. GFR refers to the number of children born per 1,000 women in a year in the reproductive age group of 15-49 years.
The average GFR in India stood at 86.1 from 2008 to 2010 (three-year period) and has come down to 68.7 during 2018-20 (average of three years), according to the Sample Registration System (SRS) data 2020 released recently. The decline, SRS data show, has been steeper in rural areas at 20.2% compared to 15.6% in urban areas.

Dr Suneeta Mittal, former head of obstetrics and gynaecology at AIIMS, told TOI that decline in GFR indicated reduction in population growth which is a good sign. "Increase in the age of marriage, improved literacy rate among women and easy availability of modern contraceptive methods are some of the key factors behind this change," she added.

The role of literacy among women in the reproductive age group in GFR reduction has also been highlighted in the SRS 2020 report that was released recently. "...there is a difference between the GFRs of the illiterate and literate women with the latter depicting lower levels of GFR at the national level," the report states, with reference to the GFR data by level of education of women.
Among the states/UTs, Jammu & Kashmir (29.2) has witnessed maximum decline in GFR followed by Delhi (28.5), Uttar Pradesh (24), Jharkhand (24) and Rajasthan (23.2) between 2008-10 and 2018-20. In Maharashtra, GFR has declined by 18.6% over the past two decades.
The total fertility rate (births per woman in reproductive age) in India is 2 as per the latest SRS data. Bihar has reported the highest TFR (3.0) while Delhi, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have reported the lowest TFR (1.4).
The SRS data show the replacement level TFR (TFR at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next, without migration) at 2.1 has been attained at the national level with Delhi (1.4), Tamil Nadu (1.4), West Bengal (1.4), Andhra Pradesh (1.5), Himachal Pradesh (1.5), Jammu & Kashmir (1.5), Kerala (1.5), Maharashtra (1.5), Punjab (1.5), Telangana (1.5), Karnataka (1.6), Odisha (1.8), Uttarakhand (1.8), Gujarat (2.0), Haryana (2.0) and Assam (2.1). At present, TFR of a rural woman is 2.2 at the national level, which is higher than that of an urban woman (1.6), the SRS report shows.

  </h2>
  <p id="literacy_p">For the purpose of census 2011, a person aged seven and above, who can both read and write with understanding in any language, is treated as literate. A person, who can only read but cannot write, is not literate. In the censuses prior to 1991, children below five years of age were necessarily treated as illiterates.

The results of 2011 census reveal that there has been an increase in literacy in the country. The literacy rate in the country is 74.04 per cent, 82.14 for males and 65.46 for females. Kerala retained its position by being on top with a 93.91 per cent literacy rate, closely followed by Lakshadweep (92.28 per cent) and Mizoram (91.58 per cent).

Bihar with a literacy rate of 63.82 per cent ranks last in the country preceded by Arunachal Pradesh (66.95 per cent) and Rajasthan (67.06 per cent).</p>
